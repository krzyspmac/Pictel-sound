Pictel-sound
============

What is it?
-----------

An easy to use, simple, C/C++ crossplatform __ogg/vorbis__ audio player.
__It can play ogg files only.__

Why does it exist?
------------------

The library is written to support my custom, 2d engine
[https://github.com/krzyspmac/Pictel](https://github.com/krzyspmac/Pictel) but can be
used in any other project.

I need a library that's:

- simple to use
- plays an open-source format (ogg/vorbis was chosen for that)
- has limited amount of functionality
- works well with different environments/systems

OGG/VORBIS
----------

The library includes a statically compiled OGG and VORBIS libraries for all
supported platforms. 

Build scripts are provided for Xcode (MacOS/iOS Device/iOS Simulator) and Windows (VS C++).
Linux & Android support coming at a later time.

Dependencies
------------

- [libogg/libvorbis](https://xiph.org/ogg)
- [miniaudio](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio) (windows & linux)

Completion
----------

Not all platform specific code has been completed.

- [x] iOS (native code)
- [x] Windows (miniaudio)
- [ ] Linux (miniaudio)
- [ ] Android (don't know yet)
